Greetings, human! (or bot).

Iâ€™ve been a programmer for a lonnnnnnnng time and I am now pivoting towards creating free software around health, venturing further into game development and creating educational material.

The main purpose of this blog will be to share back with the community things I am learning in the realm of game development, as well as other things that will hopefully help other people to learn some new things or help solve some problems they're stuck with.

If you've got any questions about anything I've posted or want to drop some feedback, you can find me on Twitter [@RobTheFiveNine](https://twitter.com/RobTheFiveNine).
