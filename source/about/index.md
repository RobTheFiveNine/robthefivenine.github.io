Greetings, human! (or bot).

I’ve been a programmer for a lonnnnnnnng time and I am now pivoting towards creating free software around health and venturing further into game development.

The main purpose of this blog will be to share back with the game dev community things I am learning in the realm of game development, which will hopefully help other people to learn some new things or help solve some problems they're stuck with.

If you've got any questions about anything I've posted or want to drop some feedback, you can find me on Twitter [@RobTheFiveNine](https://twitter.com/RobTheFiveNine).

If there’s anything I’ve shared that has been of particular use and you want to give back a bit, check out my [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/RobTheFiveNine) page.
